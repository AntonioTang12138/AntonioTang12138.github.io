An animation for the evolution of a group of lattice on a canvas. In a high temperature, the spin of each of the lattice point flips ramdomly and the magnetization(roughly the average spin of the lattice) doesn't show a preferable direction(black is spin down, white is spin up). The probability for the state of the spin in each point is equal. We call this a *symmetry*. However, if temperature decreases to the critical point (near Tc=2.269), it chooses a branch of the magnetization, either up or down(in this picutre, spin up), and condenses rapidly with an 1/8 power index. When the temperature is sufficiently low, the system condenses and the probability to flip for each lattice is also low. <br>

Once it chose a branch to condese and become quiescent gradually, the nearly negligible of the probability of flipping brings a *symmetry breaking*.

A highlight of me in freshman.
