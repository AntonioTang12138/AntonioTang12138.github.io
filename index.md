## News and Updates

- **April 2024:** An upcoming zoom Interview with [Prof. Kentaro Nagamine](http://astro-osaka.jp/kn/) at Osaka University in Japan for the application of Master's program.

- **May 15, 2024:** Interview with Osaka's was finished. The interview lasted 50 minutes and I was exhausted. In the evening, I also passed my Bachelor‘s thesis defence.

- **May 20, 2024:** Application to the Osaka Univerity was rejected. This interview was my last chance. This is a very unexpected failure because the professor there is one of my supervisor's collaborator. My supervisor suggests I prepare for the next year's application. But I haven't decided yet.

- **Nov 30, 2024:** Northwestern, WUSTL, UCSD

- **Dec. 14, 2024:** Fall quarter in UCSB ended yesterdasy. Today I updated my personal page for a new cycle of PhD application.

- **Dec. 15, 2024:** Stony Brook, Purdue, Dartmouth

-**Dec. 18, 2024:** [Dr. Jens Mahlmann](https://jensmahlmann.com/) in Dartmouth shows a interest to my background. However, it is I that didn't catch the deadline of PhD program in Dartmouth because I was so busy before the deadline. This became a great pity for me. The professor invited me to apply to the Dartmouth next year. 

-**Dec. 21, 2024:** UCSC
