## News and Updates

- **April 2024:** An upcoming zoom Interview with [Prof. Kentaro Nagamine](http://astro-osaka.jp/kn/) at Osaka University in Japan for the application of Master's program.

- **May 15, 2024:** Interview with Osaka's was finished. The interview lasted 50 minutes and I was exhausted. In the evening, I also passed my Bachelor‘s thesis defence.

- **May 20, 2024** Application to the Osaka Univerity was rejected. This interview was my last chance. This is a very unexpected failure because the professor there is one of my supervisor's collaborator. My supervisor suggests I prepare for the next year's application. But I haven't decided yet.
